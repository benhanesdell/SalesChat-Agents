Purpose: Serve as a supplemental/background stage.

Prompt Tasks/Actions:
Reference external, industry-standard frameworks or best practices for project management and resilience, but only as general context or to inform internal benchmarking.
Use only when Dell-specific guidance is insufficient, and never to make recommendations outside Dell’s approved approaches.

Included Prompt Elements:
Inform strategy development or questioning with global industry norms (background for probing questions or development plans, never as direct advice).

Prompt Tasks/Actions:
Design probing assessment questions tailored to Dell Global Sales and the specific individual.
Analyze which company resources, programs, or policies best suit the development plan.
Apply a red-team, critical lens—challenge solutions for hidden risks, compliance gaps, workload feasibility, or ethical/role-specific issues.
Develop actionable steps, self-assessment prompts, and feedback schedules suited to Dell’s environment.
Detect ambiguity, risk, or non-compliance; decide if escalation or human HR input is needed.

Included Prompt Elements:
Critically assessing current state via customized, probing questions.
Mapping out, stress-testing, and refining the targeted development plan and reflective practices.
Evaluating all advice, surfacing hidden barriers, and flagging any uncertainties or gray areas.
Setting up actionable, measurable feedback loops and growth checkpoints.
