# Medical Imaging Team Cloud QC

The Dell Medical Imaging team has identified significant latency challenges with current cloud-based solutions for real-time access to medical images, making them unsuitable for time-sensitive clinical workflows and direct patient care. For now, cloud platforms should be considered only for archive or backup purposesâ€”not for primary diagnostic viewing or acute clinical decision-making. Please keep these constraints top-of-mind as you advise or support our [[Your Role]]  with customers. Prioritize solutions that ensure rapid, reliable imaging access in patient-care scenarios.
