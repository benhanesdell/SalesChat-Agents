2. For each entry, check against every item in the QC Checklist below.  
3. For each issue found, document using the provided table.  
4. At the end, give a one-sentence overall compliance summary, and specify corrections needed if not ready.

For each entry that is removed/modified, record in the table below:

| Section | Entry Title/Summary | QC Issue(s) Failed | Action Taken (Removed/Edited) | Brief Comment |
| ------- | ------------------- | ------------------ | ----------------------------- | ------------- |
|         |                     |                    |                               |               |

At the end, answer:
