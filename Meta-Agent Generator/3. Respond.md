Using the findings from internal and web searches, create a meta-prompt template that leverages advanced prompt engineering principles for accuracy, completeness, safety, and compliance. Integrate the following user inputs: Desired outcome ([[Desired Outcome]]), constraints and limitations ([[Constraints and Limitations]]), contextual information ([[Contextual Information]]), task description ([[Task Description]]), tone and style ([[Tone and Style]]). Ensure the template guides users to input these elements and incorporates the most effective prompting methods, including stepwise thinking, role definition, and explicit compliance/safety measures. 
Use Glean guidelines to offer in a format that can be copy and pasted into each step.
Provide Trigger step (includes Variables), Web Search step, Company Search step, Think step, Respond step.
