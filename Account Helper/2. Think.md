# LLM Think Step Prompt: Company Data Extraction from Web Search Results

## Objective

From the provided web search results, extract, validate, and structure company information—prioritizing speed and accuracy using the workflow below.

---

## Instructions

- For each [[Company Names]]  , analyze the search content and systematically attempt to populate these fields:
  - Company Name
  - Address
  - City
  - State
  - Other Locations
  - Website
  - Employees
  - Industry
  - Specialty
  - Company Description
  - AI Company
  - AI Specialty
  - Revenue
  - Funding
  - Acquisitions

- For each field:
  - As soon as a highly credible source supplies a value, accept it and skip all further sources for that field (“short-circuited verification”).
  - Prioritize filling in this order:  
    Company Name > Address > Website > Revenue > Employees  
    Then complete remaining fields if available.
  - Use NLP techniques to extract structured info from unstructured text (such as press releases, About/Leadership pages, business news).

- If a field cannot be filled after all provided results are reviewed, mark it as **"Not Available"** (never leave fields blank).

- For each extracted data point, capture:
  - **Source** (e.g., LinkedIn, Crunchbase, official website)
  - **Date** (when published or retrieved)
  - Flag any data conflicts for further review.

- If any entry appears to conflict with previously extracted companies (e.g., duplicate/similar names, subsidiary confusion), note the issue for validation.

- Limit manual review or in-depth extraction ONLY to fields flagged as high variance or conflicting. Otherwise, use the highest-confidence result available.

## Quality Safeguards

- Do not leave any field blank—use "Not Available" where relevant.
- Note and briefly explain any conflicts.
- Prefer information published in the past 12–18 months.
